<h1>McFly</h1>

<h2>What is McFly?</h2>
<p>McFly is a calculator/ new programming language being developing with python. It does math calculations based on order of operations. In addition, you compare 2 numbers to each other using the = sign operator. Also, McFly can take in a string of text and return that string of text back.</p>

<h2>Things Included in McFly:</h2>

<h3>Math Operations</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>+ for addition</li>
    <li>- for subtraction</li>
    <li>* for multiplication</li>
    <li>/ for division</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Comparison Operations</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>== for comparing if 2 numbers do have the same numerical value</li> 
    <li>=== for comparing if 2 numbers have the same type and have the same numerical value</li>
    <li>> for comparing if 1 number is greater than another number</li>
    <li>< for comparing if 1 number is less than another number</li>
    <li>>= for comparing if 1 number is greater than another number or has the same numerical value</li>
    <li><= for comparing if 1 number is less than another number or has the same numerical value</li>
    <li>!= for comparing if 2 numbers do not have the same numerical value</li>
    <li>!== for comparing if 2 numbers do not have the same type and do not have the same numerical value</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>Boolean Operations</h3> 
  <ul>
    <li>not is for reversing the output of the words True/False</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>String Command</h3>
  <p><b>"</b> is used at the beginning of text to convert it to a string. In addition, the string is printed out without " printed at the beginning of the text.</p>

<h3>Special Commands</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>#pi is equal to 3.14159265</li>
     <li>#tau is equal to 6.28318531</li>   
    <li>#e is equal to 2.71828183</li>
  </ul>
  
<h2>Examples:</h2>
  <p>Input: 3+3-3*3/3 Outputs: 3.0
  <p>Input: #pi  Outputs: 3.14159265</p> 
  <p>Input: 3+#pi*2 Outputs: 9.2831853</p>
  <p>Input: 3.0==3 Outputs: True</p>
  <p>Input: 3.14==3.5 Outputs: False</p>
  <p>Input: 3.0===3 Outputs: False</p>
  <p>Input: "Hello World!" Outputs: Hello World!</p>

<h2>Installation for Windows:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Install a Python 3 version.</a> If you already have a version 3 of Python installed you can skip this step.</li>
  <li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeaFilmz/McFly/DevCode/mcfly.py">Go to the raw mcfly.py file on GitHub.</a></li>
  <li>Then right click on that page and click Save As..</li>
  <li>Next save this file with the file name mcfly and save as type Python File.</li>
  <li>After that go to where mcfly.py file is saved in File Explorer.</li>
  <li>Then go to the Address bar and click in it to highlight the text.</li>
  <li>Next delete the text and type powershell. After that hit enter.</li>
  <li>In powershell type python mcfly.py. Hit Enter. It is working and ready to use if it returns Enter a math function:</li>
  <li>If you close powershell to rerun McFly repeat instructions 5-8.
 </ol>
